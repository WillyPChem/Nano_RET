# Nano_RET
Code to simulate Resonance Energy Transfer between a nanoparticle and a small molecule dye (modeled after Malachite Green).
This code solves coupled Liouville-Lindblad equations of motion for the nanoparticle and the dye molecule, where both systems
are coupled to an incident light pulse and to each other through their transition dipole moments.
Please see the document "Nano_RET_User_Guide.pdf" for more information on numerical experiments that can be performed with the code.
